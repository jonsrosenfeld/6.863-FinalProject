# 6.863-FinalProject
## Installation 
We pre-supposed that the person planing to run this project has conda installed

We have included the yaml environment file  PT2.yaml

To create an enviroment for the project run

conda env create -f PT2.yaml



NOTE THAT THIS FILE CONTAINS A CPU BASED PYTOURCH PACKAGE
WE CAN NOT PROVIDE GPU ENVIRONMENT SINCE the appropeiate vesion of GPU-PT would depend on thr verson of CUDA on your local machine

## Repository structure
* Big_set_GR-UGR  - A set of grammatical and ungrammatical examples we sample from to construct GRAMMAR2 datasets. 
* Datasets 
   1.  
   2.  
* training_logs -The concolidated logs for all of our experiments
* figures - All figures used in the report. The figures are generated from the Logs from training_logs  
* prediction_results - The folder with the predicion results for pre-trained models
* pretrained_models
   1.  
   2.  
   3.    
  

Project files
  * TestPYT_final.py
  * helper_functions.py
  * load_model.py
  * PT2.yaml


## Commands to run

### To train a network on a dataset run 


#### On install without gpu
python -W ignore TestPYT_final.py --epochs 15 --d_hidden 20 --d_embed 50 --gpu -1 --train_dataset Datasets/different_size_train_anbn/new_train.tsv --test_dataset Datasets/different_size_train_anbn/new_dev.tsv --save_path anbn-test  | tee final-log.txt

Note that without gpu use, the training might take days, especially on  the bigger version of a^n b^n dataset ! We provide some of the pretrained models
#### On install with gpu

python -W ignore TestPYT_final.py --epochs 15 --d_hidden 20 --d_embed 50 --gpu 1 --train_dataset Datasets/different_size_train_anbn/new_train.tsv --test_dataset Datasets/different_size_train_anbn/new_dev.tsv --save_path anbn-test  | tee final-log.txt
