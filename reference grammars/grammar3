# This grammar uses a convention that
#    - terminals are lowercase          (president)
#    - preterminals are capitalized     (Noun)
#    - other nonterminals are all-caps  (NP)
# 
# This convention just makes grammars more readable to humans.  Thus:
#
#    - You should follow this convention unless you have a good reason
#      not to.
#
#    - But your *program* should still work with grammars that don't 
#      follow this convention.  It should not pay any attention to
#      upper/lower case.  From your program's point of view, 
#      if there is at least one rule for rewriting a symbol, then
#      that symbol is a nonterminal and should be rewritten.

# The basic grammar rules.  Here's what the abbreviations stand for:
#    S  = sentence
#    NP = noun phrase
#    VP = verb phrase
#    PP = prepositional phrase
#    Det = determiner (sometimes called "article")
#    Prep = preposition
#    Adj = adjective

###  Additions naming meaning: ######
#    Prop_noun = proper noun
#    AMod = adjective modifier
#    THAT = that (relating clauses - not conjection)
#    Verb_intrans = intransitive verb 
#    Verb_trans = transitive verb     
#    Verb_leftaction = 'leftaction' verb (such as thought)
#    Verb_unspecified = 'work' is given a category in itself (although not teated specifically in the current implementation)
#    Verb_ex_rightaction = all verb types excluding 'right-acting' type
#    Verb_rightaction = 'rightaction' verb (such as perplexed)
#    Verb = defunct
#    CCS = Coordinated Conjugated Sentence
#    CCs = clause level (sentence) coordinating conjugate
#    CP = Conjugating clause
#    SC	= subordinate conjugate
#    CCV = Coordinated Conjugated Verb
#    CCi = item level (noun, verb) coordinating conjugate
#    CCNP = Coordinated Conjugated noun phrase

# Vocabulary.  Your program can see that "ate" is a terminal
# symbol because there exists no rule for rewriting it.
# Any symbol that can rewrite as a terminal (or a string of 
# terminals, like "chief of staff") is called a "preterminal."  Notice 
# that a preterminal is a special kind of nonterminal.
